//! A library for parsing ACPI tables. This crate can be used by bootloaders and kernels for architectures that
//! support ACPI. This crate is not feature-complete, but can parse lots of the more common tables. Parsing the
//! ACPI tables is required for correctly setting up the APICs, HPET, and provides useful information about power
//! management and many other platform capabilities.
//!
//! This crate is designed to find and parse the static tables ACPI provides. It should be used in conjunction with
//! the `aml` crate, which is the (much less complete) AML parser used to parse the DSDT and SSDTs. These crates
//! are separate because some kernels may want to detect the static tables, but delay AML parsing to a later stage.
//!
//! This crate requires `alloc` to make heap allocations. If you are trying to find the RSDP in an environment that
//! does not have a heap (e.g. a bootloader), you can use the `rsdp` crate. The types from that crate are
//! compatible with `acpi`.
//!
//! ### Usage
//! To use the library, you will need to provide an implementation of the `AcpiHandler` trait, which allows the
//! library to make requests such as mapping a particular region of physical memory into the virtual address space.
//!
//! You then need to construct an instance of `AcpiTables`, which can be done in a few ways depending on how much
//! information you have:
//! * Use `AcpiTables::from_rsdp` if you have the physical address of the RSDP
//! * Use `AcpiTables::from_rsdt` if you have the physical address of the RSDT/XSDT
//! * Use `AcpiTables::search_for_rsdp_bios` if you don't have the address of either, but **you know you are
//! running on BIOS, not UEFI**
//! * Use `AcpiTables::from_tables_direct` if you are using the library in an unusual setting, such as in usermode,
//!   and have a custom method to enumerate and access the tables.
//!
//! `AcpiTables` stores the addresses of all of the tables detected on a platform. The SDTs are parsed by this
//! library, or can be accessed directly with `from_sdt`, while the `DSDT` and any `SSDTs` should be parsed with
//! `aml`.
//!
//! To gather information out of the static tables, a few of the types you should take a look at are:
//!    - [`PlatformInfo`](crate::platform::PlatformInfo) parses the FADT and MADT to create a nice view of the
//!      processor topology and interrupt controllers on `x86_64`, and the interrupt controllers on other platforms.
//!      `AcpiTables::platform_info` is a convenience method for constructing a `PlatformInfo`.
//!    - [`HpetInfo`](crate::hpet::HpetInfo) parses the HPET table and tells you how to configure the High
//!      Precision Event Timer.
//!    - [`PciConfigRegions`](crate::mcfg::PciConfigRegions) parses the MCFG and tells you how PCIe configuration
//!      space is mapped into physical memory.

/*
 * Contributing notes (you may find these useful if you're new to contributing to the library):
 *    - Accessing packed fields without UB: Lots of the structures defined by ACPI are defined with `repr(packed)`
 *      to prevent padding being introduced, which would make the structure's layout incorrect. In Rust, this
 *      creates a problem as references to these fields could be unaligned, which is undefined behaviour. For the
 *      majority of these fields, this problem can be easily avoided by telling the compiler to make a copy of the
 *      field's contents: this is the perhaps unfamiliar pattern of e.g. `!{ entry.flags }.get_bit(0)` we use
 *      around the codebase.
